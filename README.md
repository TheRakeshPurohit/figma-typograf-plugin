# Typograf Plugin for Figma

Figma plugin for making good typographic text.

* Removes hanging conjunctions.
* Connects the number and the unit with non-breaking space.
* Puts right quotes “outside and ‘inside’ proposals” instead programmers “ " ”.
* Removes double-spaces, double-enters, double-dots and other trash, but leaves * ellipsis.
* Makes ©, ®, ™ from (c), -- turns to — , -> transforms to →, makes ≠ from !=, mm3 turns to mm³.
* Divides 5-digit numbers or more, like 15 800.
* Removes spaces at $50 and puts non-breaking spaces at 100 % or 50 €.
* And a little more.

It's based on the [Typograf JS](https://github.com/typograf/typograf) library.
